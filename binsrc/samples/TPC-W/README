TPC-W test installation (short instrucations)

There are some instructions for installation and using tpcw test:
Test is not fully ready and fully tested. So it has errors. But main TPC-W behaviour is implemenated.
The latest versions of files are in CVS.

I. Installuction for installation server:

0. run Virtuoso server;
1. create synlink for /binsrc/samples/TPC-W in the directory from you run server.
2. you need 2 TPC-W generation tools tpcw and tpcwIMG for generation random titles and images
(Linux binaries in cvs). You can get them from tpcw site http://www.tpc.org/tpcw/default.asp
Compile if you don't have them, and put into the /binsrc/samples/TPC-W folder.
3. modify the path in function get_path() in file tpcw.sql
4. run isql from /binsrc/samples/TPC-W folder
5. load setup.isql - it should create and load databases -> server ready for work.
    you can modify procedure init_3_1000() in setup.isql:
    NUM_ITEMS - number of items in shop;
    NUM_EBs - numer of emulated browsers.

Running client:
you could run client in the same Virtuoso where server or run new server:

1. run isql
2. load /binsrc/samples/TPC-W/client/tpcw_eb.sql
3. run runShopping(NUM_ITEMS, NUM_EBs) function
    NUM_ITEMS - number of items in shop;
    NUM_EBs - numer of emulated browsers
 - it will emulate user browseing in web shop.

If you run M2 with  then in console will be some debug information for error detection.


II. Instructions for automatic load and run:
there are two shell scripts in TPC-W directory:
tpcw.sh - server installation (should be run from tpcw folder)
client/tpcw_eb.sh - client installation and running (should be run from tpcw/client folder)

Before running these scripts run .profile.
tpcw.sh - load virtuoso server and setup test tables
client/tpcw_eb.sh - load new virtuoso server and setup test procedures and functions
"tpc_eb.sh load" - load virtuoso and create procedures and functions
"tpc_eb.sh run" - run test
P.S. you should correct HTTP variable for set remote server in client/tpcw_eb.sh
