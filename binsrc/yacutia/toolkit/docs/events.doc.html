<p>Event handling is very simple in this toolkit. There are two routines that accomplish this:</p>
<h3>Dom.attach()</h3>
<p>You should supply exactly three arguments to this routine. For instance,</p>
<p class="code">var div = Dom.create("div");<br/>Dom.attach(div, "mouseover", function() { alert('Hi!'); });</p>
<p>or</p>
<p class="code">Dom.attach("some_id", "click", genericFunctionReference);</p>
<p>First argument specifies an element which should detect the event. Second is the event (without the 'on' prefix). 
Last argument is a valid function reference, i.e. a name of existing function or Anonymous function.</p>
<h3>Dom.detach()</h3>
<p>We use the same syntax as in <code>Dom.attach()</code>:</p>
<p class="code">Dom.detach(element, "click", functionReference);</p>
<p>The <code>functionReference</code> argument must exist in the current scope, so it is not possible to remove an event handled
by anonymous function.</p>
