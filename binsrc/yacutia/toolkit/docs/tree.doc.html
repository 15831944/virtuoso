<h3>Functions</h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href="#assign">Tree.assign(div, dir, ext, reformat)</a></li>
</ul>


<hr/>

<h3><a name="assign">Tree.assign(div, dir, ext, reformat)</a></h3>
<p>This will do the thing. <em>Div</em> specifies a container in which your list lives. <em>Dir</em> 
is a directory containing important images, <em>ext</em> is their extension and <em>reformat</em> is a boolean value, 
specifying whether do you want to reformat (i.e. collapse all deep levels) the tree. Example:</p>

<p class="code">Tree.assign("myDiv", "images", "png", true);</p>
