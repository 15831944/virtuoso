	<title>Installation Guide</title>
	<abstract>
<para>This chapter applies exclusively to the various commercial releases of Virtuoso.  If you are working with the open source version, please refer to the instructions on the web site where you obtained it.  
</para>
<para>
This chapter describes how to install OpenLink Virtuoso VDBMS.  It 
contains both a quick start install guide and full walk through install guides 
for major platforms.</para>
</abstract>

  <para>Virtuoso has been designed from the ground-up to be easy to implement.</para>
	<para>The installation generally runs without problems, run the setup program or script and follow
	the on screen instruction prompts.  You will be asked some questions, if in any doubt please follow
	the instructions in this guide in order to install and configure your Virtuoso components correctly. </para>

	<para>Once installed, each instance of Virtuoso is controlled by an
INI (initialization) file.  This file links the Virtuoso Server
process with an actual database file or device.  For example, the demo
instance of Virtuoso on all platforms is controlled by the demo.ini
file that is found in the demo directory along with the demo.db and
related files.  There is a one-to-one relationship between server
processes and database files.</para>

<para>The INI file is a text file consisting of keys and key values.
You will set several of these values during installation.  At any time
thereafter, their values can be changed by editing the INI file with a
standard text editor.</para>

<para>The details of the INI file sections, keys, and the meanings of
the key values are described in the <link
linkend="configsrvstupfiles">Configuring Server Startup Files</link>
section.

				<title>Reinstalling Virtuoso?</title>
				<para>If you are reinstalling Virtuoso, you must first shutdown any
    additional database servers you have configured on non default ports.
    The databases on port 1111 and 1112 will automatically be stopped during the install process.
    On Windows NT/2000/XP, go to the services applet in the Control Panel.  There 
    you can stop services that appear with names of the form &quot;OpenLink 
    Virtuoso DBMS Server [instance name]&quot;.</para>
				<para>On Windows NT/2000/XP you can also shut them down with the following
    commands in the Virtuoso\bin directory:</para>
				<programlisting>
virtuoso-odbc-t.exe +service stop
virtuoso-odbc-t.exe +instance myinstance +service stop
virtuoso-odbc-t.exe +instance anotherinstance +service stop
</programlisting>

<note><title>Note:</title>
<para>There is an alternative executable available for Virtuoso 
called: virtuoso-odbc-f.exe, which you may have installed.  This version is 
designed for versions of Windows that offer no native threading support 
such as Windows 98, and offers no advantages over virtuoso-odbc-t.exe 
for Windows NT/2000/XP.</para></note>

				<para>You can list the services with their status using:</para>

</table>
				<para>By default, the Virtuoso DBMS listens on port 1111.
    This port number is not selectable at install time.
    If the port is currently in use by another server then after the installation completes
    you will need to change the port number in the Local Virtuoso ODBC DSN that is created
    during the installation process, and also in the following file:</para>
				<programlisting>
C:\Program Files\OpenLink Software\Virtuoso 5.0\bin\virtuoso.ini
</programlisting>
				<para>To check if a port is in use on NT, you can use the
    following command, and review the output:</para>
				<programlisting>
netstat -an | more

			<sect3 id="prevworkodbcdsn">
				<title>Do you already have an ODBC Data Source Name (DSN) that works?</title>
				<para>The Virtual Database aspects of the Virtuoso for ODBC assumes that you already
	have an ODBC driver on your machine from a database vendor, OpenLink Software, or from another 3rd party vendor.
	It is a useful sanity-check to ensure that you have an ODBC System Data Source Name (DSN) on your
    machine, and that it successfully connects to your database, and that it retrieve
    data.  Any ODBC compliant tool can be used to test that your ODBC Data Source Name
    (DSN) works, such as the sample application we provide - C++ Demo32, and that it is
    sufficiently robust to operate with Virtuoso. Virtuoso is ODBC Driver Independent and
    certified to work with any drivers that are ODBC level 1 or higher.</para>
