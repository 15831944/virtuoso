    <para>Virtuoso can be set up to retrieve content from external web sites and host it in its own
WebDAV repository via this page.

    <para><emphasis>Target Description</emphasis> lets you provide a friendly description for the
target that you are defining.
    </para>
    <para><emphasis>Target URL</emphasis> is the url of the web site that you are trying
to retrieve content from. Only the hostname should be provided here, along with the protocol. For
example http://www.myhost.com.
    </para>
    <para><emphasis>Login name on target</emphasis> is the username for accessing the remote server,
if required.
    </para>
    <para><emphasis>Login password on target</emphasis> is the password for the login name above.
    </para>
    <para><emphasis>Copy to Local DAV collection</emphasis> is the name of the collection (folder)
where retrieved content will be stored in Dav.
    </para>
		<para>
<emphasis>Single page download</emphasis> radio button specifies whether
Virtuoso will retrieved linked content also.</para>
		<para>
<emphasis>Local Resources Owner</emphasis> The DAV user that will be the owner
of the content that will copied to DAV.
</para>
		<para>
The <emphasis>Download only newer than</emphasis> field allows you to specify
a datetime value to prevent Virtuoso downloading files that are older than
that datetime.</para>
		<para>
Use the <emphasis>Follow Links Matching</emphasis> field to limit the content
that is downloaded by specify pattern matching criteria.</para>
		<para>
<emphasis>Do NOT follow links matching</emphasis> allows you limit content by
specifying what files not to download.</para>
		<para>
<emphasis>Download Images</emphasis> radio buttons to allow Virtuoso to pull
down image type also.  You may want to prevent this if you are more interested
in the textual content rather than bandwidth draining images.</para>
		<para>
<emphasis>Use WebDAV methods</emphasis> can be checked if the host is known to
support WebDAV methods.  This would enable better copying of sites that support DAV.</para>
		<para>
<emphasis>Delete if Remove on Remote is Detected</emphasis> can be switched on
so that when Virtuoso synchronizes its content with that on the remote host
it will check for files that have been removed on the remote and remove
them from the local copy also.</para>
		<para>
<emphasis>Store metadata*</emphasis> when checked offers to be stored respectively
metadata from FOAF, RDF, RSS/RDF and GRDLL data depending on which check-box is checked.</para>
    <para>
When all details have been completed press the <emphasis>Add</emphasis> (or
Update if updating) button to submit the web robot task to the queue.

  <sect3 id="importqueues">
			<title>Import Queues</title>
    <para>The "Imported Queues" page shows you a list of web copy targets that have been enlisted with the
Virtuoso Server, and a list of web robot update schedules. Several options are available for
each item listed: Start, Update, Schedule, Reset, and Stop. You can configure the scheduled update
interval by pressing the Schedule link and entering a value in minutes. Once that is done you can
start the schedule by pressing the Start link. You make a manual update of the content by pressing
the Update link. You can stop the scheduled updates taking place by pressing the Stop link. To reset
the details of the web copy item press the Reset link.

    <para>You can view a list of the links retrieved from the web copy from this page. You are also

			<title>Export</title>
    <para>You can export content from the WebDAV repository. Note that you can only export content
that has been retrieved using Virtuoso's Web Robot.
    </para>
    <para>When you click the "Export" link for a retrieved collection, you will be presented
with a form for selecting the export target location. Choose the export method: either File
System or DAV by clicking the "External WebDAV Server URL" check-box. This lets you indicate to
the remote target where to store the exported content. Then type the target URL to an existing
location on the server. Finally press the <emphasis>Export</emphasis> button to export.
A confirmation will be supplied once the operation is complete.

      <title>Note:</title>
      <para>If is not checked the "External WebDAV Server URL" check-box, i.e. you are selecting the
filesystem method, then you are restricted to Virtuoso targets. However WebDAV methods can be applied
to any WebDAV server. WebDAV methods assume that the target is publicly available for writing.

  <sect3 id="admiui.accesscontrol"><title>Access Control</title>
    <para>From "System Admin"/"Access Controls" you can manage Rules and ACL respectively for HTTP, News and Proxy.

          <figure float="1" id="acl001"><title>Access Control Lists</title>
      <graphic fileref="ui/acl001.png"/>
    </figure>
    <para>For each of the tabs "HTTP", "NEWS", "PROXY" the created rules will be shown in a list with
Filter, Access, Destination, Object, Mode, Rate values. You can also add/delete rules, re-arrange rules order.
    </para>
    <figure float="1" id="acl002"><title>Access Control List for HTTP</title>
      <graphic fileref="ui/acl002.png"/>

  <sect3 id="admiui.wsdl"><title>Import WSDL</title>
    <para>From "Web Services" / "WSDL Import/Export" you can provide a URL to a WSDL description.
In return Virtuoso will automatically provide a wrapper for the services available, hence stored
procedures and user-defined types that are callable within Virtuoso while the processing and mechanics of
the services are actually handled at the source.
    </para>
        <figure float="1" id="wsdlimp001"><title>WSDL Import</title>
      <graphic fileref="ui/wsdlimp001.png"/>
    </figure>
    <para>After Virtuoso examines the supplied URL to a WSDL you are presented with the source
code for the PL wrappers and Virtuoso user-defined types to be created. You have the chance to
edit the code for more specific needs and then you can either save this to a file for later
work, or execute it in Virtuoso to create the procedures and types.
    </para>
          <figure float="1" id="wsdlimp002"><title>WSDL Import</title>
      <graphic fileref="ui/wsdlimp002.png"/>

    <para>Any errors in the code will be highlighted if you try and execute it.
    </para>
    <para>If you wish to save the file the appropriate file system ACLs must be in place for
the destination.
