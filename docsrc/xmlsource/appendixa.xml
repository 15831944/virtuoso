<sect1 id="apndxregexp"><title>Basic Syntax of Regular Expressions</title>

<para>The two special symbols: <computeroutput>'^'</computeroutput> and 
<computeroutput>'$'</computeroutput> indicate the <emphasis>start</emphasis> 
and the <emphasis>end</emphasis> of a string respectively, like so:</para>

<simplelist>
  <member><computeroutput>^The</computeroutput>: matches any string 
  that starts with The;</member>
  <member><computeroutput>of despair$</computeroutput>: matches a 
  string that ends in the substring of despair;</member>
  <member><computeroutput>^abc$</computeroutput>: a string that 
  starts and ends with abc -- that could only be abc itself!</member>
  <member><computeroutput>notice</computeroutput>: a string that 
  has the text notice in it.</member>
</simplelist>

<para>Without either of the above special character you are allowing the pattern 
to occur anywhere inside the string.</para>

<para>The symbols <computeroutput>'*'</computeroutput>, <computeroutput>'+'</computeroutput>, 
and <computeroutput>'?'</computeroutput> denote the number of times a character 
or a sequence of characters may occur.  What they mean is: zero or more, one or 
more, and zero or one.  Here are some examples:</para>

<simplelist>
  <member><computeroutput>ab*</computeroutput>: matches a string 
  that has an <emphasis>a</emphasis> followed by zero or more 
  <emphasis>b</emphasis>'s (a, ab, abbb, etc.);</member>
  <member><computeroutput>ab+</computeroutput>: same, but there is 
  at least one <emphasis>b</emphasis> (ab, abbb, etc.);</member>
  <member><computeroutput>ab?</computeroutput>: there might be a 
  <emphasis>b</emphasis> or not;</member> 
  <member><computeroutput>a?b+$</computeroutput>: a possible <emphasis>a</emphasis> 
  followed by one or more <emphasis>b</emphasis>'s ending a string.</member>
</simplelist>

<para>You can also use <emphasis>bounds</emphasis>, which come inside braces 
and indicate ranges in the number of occurrences: </para>

<simplelist>
  <member><computeroutput>ab{2}</computeroutput>: matches a string that has an 
  <emphasis>a</emphasis> followed by exactly two <emphasis>b</emphasis>'s 
  (abb);</member>
  <member><computeroutput>ab{2,}</computeroutput>: there are at least two 
  <emphasis>b</emphasis>'s (abb, abbbb, etc.);</member>
  <member><computeroutput>ab{3,5}</computeroutput>: from three to five 
  <emphasis>b</emphasis>'s (abbb, abbbb, or abbbbb).</member>
</simplelist>

<para>Note, that you must always specify the first number of a range 
(i.e, <computeroutput>{0,2}</computeroutput>, not <computeroutput>{,2}</computeroutput>).  
Also, as you may have noticed, the symbols '*', '+', and '?' have the same effect 
as using the bounds <computeroutput>{0,}</computeroutput>, 
<computeroutput>{1,}</computeroutput>, and <computeroutput>{0,1}</computeroutput>, 
respectively.</para>

<para>Now, to quantify a sequence of characters, put them inside parentheses:</para>

<simplelist>
  <member><computeroutput>a(bc)*</computeroutput>: matches a string that has 
  an <emphasis>a</emphasis> followed by zero or more copies of the sequence bc;</member>
  <member><computeroutput>a(bc){1,5}</computeroutput>: one through five copies of bc.</member>
</simplelist>

<para>There's also the '|' symbol, which works as an OR operator:</para>

<simplelist>
  <member><computeroutput>hi|hello</computeroutput>: matches a string that has 
  either hi or hello in it;</member>
  <member><computeroutput>(b|cd)ef</computeroutput>: a string that has either 
  bef or cdef;</member>
  <member><computeroutput>(a|b)*c</computeroutput>: a string that has a 
  sequence of alternating <emphasis>a</emphasis>'s and <emphasis>b</emphasis>'s 
  ending in a <emphasis>c</emphasis>;</member>
</simplelist>

<para>A period ('.') stands for any single character:</para>

<simplelist>
  <member><computeroutput>a.[0-9]</computeroutput>: matches a string that has 
  an <emphasis>a</emphasis> followed by one character and a digit;</member>
  <member><computeroutput>^.{3}$</computeroutput>: a string with exactly 3 characters.</member>
</simplelist>

<para><emphasis>Bracket expressions</emphasis> specify which characters are 
allowed in a single position of a string: </para>

<simplelist>
  <member><computeroutput>[ab]</computeroutput>: matches a string that has 
  either an <emphasis>a</emphasis> or a <emphasis>b</emphasis>
    (that's the same as <computeroutput>a|b</computeroutput>);</member>
  <member><computeroutput>[a-d]</computeroutput>: a string that has lowercase 
  letters 'a' through 'd' (that's equal to <computeroutput>a|b|c|d</computeroutput> 
  and even <computeroutput>[abcd]</computeroutput>);</member>
  <member><computeroutput>^[a-zA-Z]</computeroutput>: a string that starts with a letter;</member>
  <member><computeroutput>[0-9]%</computeroutput>: a string that has a single 
  digit before a percent sign;</member>
  <member><computeroutput>,[a-zA-Z0-9]$</computeroutput>: a string that ends in 
  a comma followed by an alphanumeric character.</member>
</simplelist>

<para>You can also list the characters that do NOT want -- just use a '^' as 
the first symbol in a bracketed expression (i.e., 
<computeroutput>%[^a-zA-Z]%</computeroutput> matches a string with a character 
that is not a letter between two percent signs).</para>

<para>Do not forget that bracket expressions are an exception to that 
rule--inside them, all special characters, including the backslash ('\'), 
lose their special powers (i.e., <computeroutput>[*\+?{}.]</computeroutput> 
matches exactly any of the characters inside the brackets).  
To include a literal ']' in the list, make it the first character 
(following a possible '^'). To include a literal '-', make it the first or last 
character, or the second endpoint of a range.</para>

<sect1 id="apndxclientcompilance"><title>Server &amp; client versions compatibility</title>
    <para>
	The RPC protocol has changed between 2.7 and 3.0 versions.  Thus, not all 
	clients can connect to all servers.  For best results, the version should be identical on 
	both ends of ODBC and JDBC connections.  However, the following table shows which 
	combinations should generally be successful.
