	  If bad, stop or fix, else no message and containue as is or reset the
	  seek if not landed. For locks, when there is checkpoint freeze, the
	  condition could result in rollback instead of freeze if detected just
	  before deadlock check or right after lock wait ended. So must consider
	  the freeze case specially.
